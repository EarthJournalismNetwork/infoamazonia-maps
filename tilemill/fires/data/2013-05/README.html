README: LANCE FIRMS MODIS Fire/Hotspot Data Download<br>
===============================================<br>
<p>
This zip file supplied to you contains active fire data for the requested dates in your area-of-interest. The data may include fire detections from MODAPS, the definitive version of Collection 5 (version 5.1), and from LANCE Rapid Response [RR] (version 5.0). The "version" field in the attached data indicates the source. Please refer to the following FAQ for more information for the difference between MODAPS and MRR at <a href="http://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/nrt-data/help/faq#firms35">http://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/nrt-data/help/faq#firms35</a>
</p>
<p>
<i><u>Please note</u></i>: If your request results in no fire points, the accompanying ZIP file will include an empty CSV file with a header, or an empty DBF file. If you believe that this has occurred due to an error, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@earthdata.nasa.gov?subject=FIRMS Download Tool">support@earthdata.nasa.gov</a>

PROJECTION INFORMATION<br>
======================<br>
</p>

<p>
The MODIS hotspot data supplied to you are in the WGS-84 geographic projection (the "latitude/longitude projection").For help on importing the data into your local GIS, please refer to our FAQ at <a href="http://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/nrt-data/help/faq">http://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/nrt-data/help/faq</a>.
